# Console Game Othello


Symbols used in the game are not synchronized with the usual terminal font, hence I recommend 
starting it in a Visual Studio Code debugger. You can do that by opening 
Othello.cpp in vs code and clicking f5. Other opions is to compile OthelloSymbols.cpp which uses letters.
 This should work on windows as well as linux.
Othello.cpp must be in the same directory as Grid8x8.hpp, rules.txt and saveFile.txt for it to work properly.
OthelloSymbols.cpp must be in the same directory as Grid8x8Symbols.hpp, rules.txt and saveFile.txt for it to work properly.
