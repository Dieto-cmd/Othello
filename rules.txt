The game is played on the 8x8 grid.

and 2 black circles in the middle.
Black player starts by placing a black circle on the grid
in a way that outflanks at least one white circle.

so that your opponent's row (or rows) of circle(s)
is bordered at each end by a disc of your colour.
(A "row" may be made up of one or more circles).
Outflanking works horizontally, vertically and diagonally.
Then all outflanked circles change
their color to the opposing one.
Then a white players places his circle and so on.
Turns alternate until there is no room on the board.
